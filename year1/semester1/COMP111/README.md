# COMP111 – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This module introduced the **core ideas behind Artificial Intelligence**. The focus was on understanding how intelligent behaviour can be modelled and reasoned about, rather than on implementing AI systems in code.

The module was mostly **theoretical**, with a strong emphasis on logical reasoning, problem solving, and formal thinking.
