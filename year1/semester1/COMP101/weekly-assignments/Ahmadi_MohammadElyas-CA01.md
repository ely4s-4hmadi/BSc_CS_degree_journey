# Assignment 01 (Barge Draft Calculation)

This was the first programming assignment in COMP101 and focused entirely on using **sequence constructs**. No conditions, loops, functions, or validation were allowed, so the task was about writing clear, structured code with correct calculations.

---

## Task Summary
The task was to write a Python program that:
- Takes user input for the **length, breadth, and height** of a barge
- Calculates the **surface area** of the barge (four walls and the floor)
- Calculates the **mass** based on a fixed iron weight per square metre
- Calculates the **draft** of the barge
- Outputs the input values (echoing), surface area, mass, and draft in a clear format

Python was used only as a tool to apply programming fundamentals, not advanced features.

## My Approach
I solved the problem step by step using a **clear sequence of calculations**:
1. Read input values from the user
2. Calculate base area and wall areas
3. Compute the total surface area
4. Calculate mass using the given constant
5. Calculate draft using the required formula
6. Format and display all outputs clearly

I kept the code readable with meaningful variable names and minimal but useful inline comments.

## Concepts Used
- Sequence control flow
- User input and type casting
- Arithmetic calculations
- Variables and constants
- Output formatting using f-strings
- Inline comments and testing

## Testing
At the end of the file, I included a **test table** with multiple input cases to verify that the calculations were correct.  
All tests produced the expected results when rounded to two decimal places.

## Personal Notes
This assignment helped me understand the importance of **designing the solution before coding**. Even without loops or conditions, writing clear and well-structured code made the logic easy to follow and test.
