# COMP101 – Introduction to Programming

This module was my **first proper introduction to programming** at university. The focus was not just on writing code, but on learning how to **think like a programmer** — using structured design, computational thinking, and disciplined problem-solving.

Python was used as the tool, but the module was **not about learning Python syntax**. Instead, it focused on developing strong programming foundations using the **procedural programming paradigm**.

## What I Learned
In this module, I learned how to:

- Approach problems using **computational thinking**
- Design solutions before coding using:
  - Pseudocode
  - Flowcharts
  - Structured design methods
- Write **robust and well-structured Python programs**
- Apply discipline in:
  - Code structure
  - Documentation
  - Testing
- Think like a **programmer**, not just a “coder”

---

## Programming Concepts Covered
- Control structures:
  - Sequence
  - Selection
  - Iteration
- Data types, variables, constants, and type casting
- Input and output (I/O)
- Number and string handling
- Functions and modularisation
- Exception handling
- Basic data structures:
  - Collections
  - 1D and 2D arrays

---

## Analysis, Design & Documentation
A strong emphasis was placed on:
- Analysing problems before coding
- Designing solutions clearly and logically
- Writing readable code using a consistent house style
- Inline commenting
- Testing and evaluating program correctness

---

## Not Covered in Assessment
Some topics were introduced but **not assessed**, including:
- Standard algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, hashing, etc.)
- Objects and classes
- Files and streams
- Advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees)

---

## Skills I Developed
- Computational and logical thinking  
- Structured problem-solving  
- Writing clean, readable code  
- Designing solutions before implementation  
- Testing and debugging programs effectively

## Personal Notes
COMP101 helped me build a **strong foundation in programming**. It taught me that good programming is not about rushing to write code, but about careful thinking, design, and testing. This module set the mindset needed for more advanced computer science and AI modules later in the degree.
